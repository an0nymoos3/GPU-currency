# $GPUD

## What is GPUD
GPUD is short for Graphics Processing Unit Dollar. It started as a stupid bit about comparing 
expensive purchases to how many GPUs you could by for the same amount of money in 2024.

## Roadmap
To start with this project will create a binary that converts a USD price to a GPUD price. 
However "we" see plenty of growth potential. Therefore "we" would like to add these features:

  - More currencies.
  - A website for easier converions, without the need to download a binary.
  - A public API for developers to offer GPUD as a currency to their customers.
