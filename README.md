# $GPUD

## What is GPUD
GPUD is short for Graphics Processing Unit Dollar. It started as a stupid bit about comparing 
expensive purchases to how many GPUs you could by for the same amount of money in 2024.

## Building yourself 
I have supplied a Makefile to make building easy. 
Make sure you have Go installed on your system.

- Execute ```make build``` in a terminal to build a binary. The binary is compiled and placed in bin/.
- Execute ```make run``` to build and automatically run the binary.
- Execute ```make clean``` to remove the previously built binary.

## Roadmap
To start with this project will create a binary that converts a USD price to a GPUD price. 
However "we" see plenty of growth potential. Therefore "we" would like to add these features:

  - More currency conversions.
  - A website for easier conversions, without the need to download a binary.
  - A public API for developers to offer GPUD as a currency to their customers.

## Shout out
Big thanks to `https://bestvaluegpu.com/` for an awesome website tracking GPU prices.
